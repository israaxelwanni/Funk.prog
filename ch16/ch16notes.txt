non-overlapping functions = Patterns that do not rely on the order in which 
                            they are matched.

In order to simplify the process of reasoning about programs, 
it is good practice to use non-overlapping patterns whenever 
possible when defining functions

Haskell programs involve some form of recursion. Reasoning about such programs 
normally proceeds using the simple but powerful technique of induction.


data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat

add :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
add Zero m = m
add (Succ n) m = Succ (add n m)
